# 🧬 AgentLab — Build Agents, Not Just Apps

AgentLab is an AI-native playground for transforming human intent into deployable software. Users describe their ideal agent in plain language, and AgentLab parses, orchestrates, and executes modular workflows that feel alive.

🚀 Made for HUMAIN. Built by Vibes.
